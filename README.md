## William Park - Year 4 Interaction Design Submission



### Major Project

**Habeats GitHub Prototype Repository**
You can see the code for the application here. Most of the code that was wrote by myself can be viewed in the `/src` directory.

---

**Habeats Android Prototype**
This is the Android prototype that is built with React Native. To run this prototype you must download the app "Expo Client" from the Google Play Store.  You can then scan the QR code on the following page using the camera in the "Expo Client" app to open Habeats.

**Habeats Website**
https://www.habeats.app/

*Note: Visiting the app via https://habeats.app/ (no www.) may give you an error. I'm unable to fix this without changing the host of the website but I'm aware it's an issue.*
